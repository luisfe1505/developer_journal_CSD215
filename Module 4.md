## AWS Cloud Security

**AWS Shared Responsibility model**

- Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer
- AWs is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services offered. (hardware, software, networking...)
- the customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and the encryption of data in transit.

- AWS is in charge of the security of the cloud
- And AWS is responsible for the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources:
  - Physical security of data centers

  - Network infrastructure
