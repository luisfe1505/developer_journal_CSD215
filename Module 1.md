What is cloud computing?

On-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with pay as you go pricing.
enables you to stop thinking of you infrastructure as hardware, instead, think of it as software

1. Traditional Infrastructure (Hardware-based)
Physical Nature: Relies on tangible equipment. This demands significant overhead including floor space, physical security, specialized staff, and large upfront Capital Expenditure (CapEx).

Capacity Planning Issues: You are forced to forecast your maximum theoretical demand.

Over-provisioning: If demand is lower than predicted, you waste money on idle resources.

Under-provisioning: If demand spikes above your limit, your system crashes or fails to serve customers.

Rigidity: Adapting to new requirements is slow and expensive, requiring new hardware cycles.

2. Infrastructure as Software (Cloud approach)
Agility: Highly flexible; allows for rapid, simple, and cost-efficient changes compared to hardware.

Operational Efficiency: Removes "undifferentiated heavy lifting" tasks (like racking servers or managing cooling).

Strategic Focus: Frees up your team to concentrate on business logic rather than maintenance.

3. Primary Cloud Service Models
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Offers raw IT resources. You rent access to networking, servers (compute), and storage. This model gives you the maximum control over the operating system and configuration (closest to managing physical hardware).

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Removes the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure (OS and hardware). It provides a framework so you can focus strictly on deploying and managing your applications.

SaaS (Software as a Service): A fully managed product run by the provider. Usually refers to end-user applications. You have zero responsibility for maintenance or infrastructure; you simply use the software functionality.

4. Deplyoment models 
Cloud-Native (Public Cloud): Applications are either built directly in the cloud or fully migrated there. They run on the provider's infrastructure.

Hybrid: A bridge approach that connects your cloud-based resources with your existing on-premises infrastructure, allowing data and apps to move between them.

On-Premises (Private Cloud): Leveraging virtualization and resource management tools within your own data center. While it offers dedicated resources, it generally lacks the scalability and cost benefits of the public cloud.
