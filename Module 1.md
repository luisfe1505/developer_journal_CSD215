What is cloud computing?

On-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with pay as you go pricing.
enables you to stop thinking of you infrastructure as hardware, instead, think of it as software

1. Traditional Infrastructure (Hardware-based)
Physical Nature: Relies on tangible equipment. This demands significant overhead including floor space, physical security, specialized staff, and large upfront Capital Expenditure (CapEx).

Capacity Planning Issues: You are forced to forecast your maximum theoretical demand.

Over-provisioning: If demand is lower than predicted, you waste money on idle resources.

Under-provisioning: If demand spikes above your limit, your system crashes or fails to serve customers.

Rigidity: Adapting to new requirements is slow and expensive, requiring new hardware cycles.

2. Infrastructure as Software (Cloud approach)
Agility: Highly flexible; allows for rapid, simple, and cost-efficient changes compared to hardware.

Operational Efficiency: Removes "undifferentiated heavy lifting" tasks (like racking servers or managing cooling).

Strategic Focus: Frees up your team to concentrate on business logic rather than maintenance.

3. Primary Cloud Service Models
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Offers raw IT resources. You rent access to networking, servers (compute), and storage. This model gives you the maximum control over the operating system and configuration (closest to managing physical hardware).

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Removes the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure (OS and hardware). It provides a framework so you can focus strictly on deploying and managing your applications.

SaaS (Software as a Service): A fully managed product run by the provider. Usually refers to end-user applications. You have zero responsibility for maintenance or infrastructure; you simply use the software functionality.
Similarities between AWS and traditional IT

4. Deplyoment models 
Cloud-Native (Public Cloud): Applications are either built directly in the cloud or fully migrated there. They run on the provider's infrastructure.

Hybrid: A bridge approach that connects your cloud-based resources with your existing on-premises infrastructure, allowing data and apps to move between them.

On-Premises (Private Cloud): Leveraging virtualization and resource management tools within your own data center. While it offers dedicated resources, it generally lacks the scalability and cost benefits of the public cloud.

ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING

Trade capital expense for variable expense: capex are funds that a company uses to aquire, upgrade and maintain physical assests, (basically you pay it wheter you use it or not) Instead, variable expenses you pay only for the amount you consume, maintenance is reduced
Benefit from massive economies of scale: big cloud providors have huge amounts of costumers, so they can get the resourses at lower prices, which means that the lower prices will go as well to the costumers when paying just what you use
Stop guessing capacity: Eliminate the guessing about your infrastrucutre capacity needs. With cloud computing you can access as much or as little as you need in the moment, scaling up and down as required.
Increase speed and agility: IT resources are just a click away, you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to minutes.
stop spending money on running and mainaining data centers: Focus on the business needs instead of the heavy lifting, of racking stacking and powering servers
Go global in minutes: You can deploy an app in multiple regions whith just a few clicks.

Aquí tienes la segunda parte reescrita. Al igual que antes, he mantenido los términos oficiales (que suelen ser las respuestas del examen) pero he cambiado totalmente la explicación para que sea original y fácil de entender.

6 Core Advantages of Cloud Computing
Swap CapEx for Variable Expense: Instead of investing heavily upfront in data centers and servers (Capital Expenditure) before you know how you'll use them, you switch to a pay-as-you-go model. You only pay for computing resources when you consume them.

Leverage Massive Economies of Scale: Because cloud providers like AWS purchase at a gigantic scale, they get lower costs than you ever could. These savings are passed on to you as lower prices (pay-as-you-go rates).

Eliminate Capacity Guesswork: Stop trying to predict how much infrastructure you need. In the cloud, you can scale up or down instantly to match demand, rather than paying for idle resources or running out of capacity.

Boost Speed and Agility: New IT resources can be launched in minutes, not weeks. This drastically reduces the time it takes to experiment and develop, making your organization much more agile.

Stop Managing Infrastructure: Don't waste money and time on "undifferentiated heavy lifting" (racking, stacking, cooling, and powering servers). Let the cloud provider handle that so you can focus on your customers/business.

Global Reach in Minutes: You can deploy your application to multiple physical locations (Regions) around the world instantly, offering lower latency to global customers with just a few clicks.

Introduction to AWS
Defining a Web Service: It is any software available over the internet using a standardized format (like XML or JSON) for communication. It is interoperable, meaning it doesn't care what Operating System or language you use; it describes itself via an interface so other systems can find and talk to it.

What is AWS?: A secure cloud platform offering a vast collection of on-demand products (compute, storage, DB, etc.).

Delivery: Accessed via the internet.
Pricing: Pay-as-you-go (Operational Expense).
Structure: Think of AWS services as "LEGO building blocks." You don't just use one; you combine different services to build complex, scalable, and custom solutions.

ays to interact with AWS

AWS management console. Graphical interface
CLI. Access to services by discrete commands or scripts
Software DEvelopmennt Kits (SDKs). Access services directly from you code.
